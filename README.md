## The Frontend -
There is a vanilla JS/React frontend for this project, located in [this](https://github.com/gnardinosaur/culture_frontend) repo. 

## Additional Notes -
This was my final project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering immersive program. The main goal was to use new technologies I had not yet utilized and build an application that would email a user upon some action.

I originally intended for the application to send users a daily email but ran into some hurdles with cron and the Mac OS I'm running, Catalina. 

It took me roughly four days to ideate and draw out the UI, and about a week and half to build.
